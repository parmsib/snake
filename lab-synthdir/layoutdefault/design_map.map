    Number used as logic:                      787 out of   9,112    8%
      Number using O6 output only:             481
      Number using O5 output only:              92
      Number using O5 and O6:                  214
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     11
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:        11
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   246 out of   2,278   10%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          798
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           380 out of     798   47%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of     798    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         418 out of     798   52%
    Number of unique control sets:              15
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              62 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
