WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   test_clk[25]_GND_6_o_equal_67_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <rst_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.

    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      3
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         3
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    26 out of   2,278    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           81
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            47 out of      81   58%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      81    0%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
