Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        8,942
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         4,142 out of   8,942   46%
    Number with an unused LUT:               4,170 out of   8,942   46%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         630 out of   8,942    7%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:           3,976 out of  18,224   21%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
